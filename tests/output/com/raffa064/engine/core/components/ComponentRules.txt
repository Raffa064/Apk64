Follow these steps to prevent bugs in your moving objects:

1. Calculate translations:
   velX = 1

2. Update translations:
   pos.x += velX

3. Render:
   batch.draw(texture, pos.x, pos.y)

If you don't follow this order, the movement may cause a delayed effect.

This is specilly important in the order that you place components in your objects:

	Scene.createObject('Object', playerController, transform, image)
	
In the example, playerController is a component that can apply player movements, transform is a Transform2D component, that will update global transformations, and image is a Image component, that will renderize player sprite in the global coordinates
